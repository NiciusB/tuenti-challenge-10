 Okay so here is the riddle.
    I went to the zombie market to buy some food to throw
    the perfect zombie party. I bought X brains.
    If I divide them between 2 zombies there will be 1 remaining brain.
    If I divide them between 3 zombies there will be 2 remaining brains.
    If I divide them between 4 zombies there will be 3 remaining brains.
    If I divide them between 5 zombies there will be 4 remaining brains.
    If I divide them between 6 zombies there will be 5 remaining brains.
    But if I divide them between 7 zombies there won't be any brains left!
    Do you know the minimum number X of brains I bought?
 If you figure out the solution, please just tell it directly to me.
